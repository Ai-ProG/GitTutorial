git branch -a
goto branch
git checkout <branchname-1>
git checkout <branchname-2>

if you are happy to merge
git checkout master
git merge <branchname-2> lets say you are happy with 2

If there is some conflicts lets say c wants to write some feature but master also has made the changes like c wants


git checkout -b branch-c
git checkout master

master made some file c wants to work.
git add .
git commit -m " add some new things"

But c was working the same file.

git checkout branch-c
edited the same type of file
git add .
git commit -m "added some feature"

git checkout master

git merge branch-c
throws an error merge fail.

now check the file with error and edit then
git add .
git commit
show the commit file
use :q
now it will merge the branch

git log --oneline
