Branches creates a isolated environment to test the code.
Since it does not make changes to master branch we can test or delete if it doesnot work.
IF our test works we can merge to the master branch using merge commit.

git branch <branchname>
to see branch
git branch -a

to checkout branch
git checkout <branchname>

show switched to branch ..

so check git branch -a it will shows you in new branch

edit some text
git add .
git status
git commit -m "added new feature"

so it is in isolate branch now go to master branch

master branch is not edited to check 
git checkout master----it will switch to master

you can delete branch if anythings goes wrong use
Person -1
git branch -D <branchname>

git checkout -b <branchname> ----switch and create to new branch

git add .
git commit -m "added some feature"

Person -2
git checkout -b <branchname> ----switch and create to new branch

git add .
git commit -m "added some feature2"

git checkout master----doesnot show any branch created by both person
git branch -a --- to see if there are any branches created
